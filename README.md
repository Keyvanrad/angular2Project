# Running this Angular 2 Application
This is my first project in angular2 to learn more about the framework and have fun with loose coupling!

1. Download the application source code
1. Install NodeJS `https://nodejs.org/`
1. Using the command line, goto the target folder `(cd target)`
1. In the commaind line run :
      * `npm install`
      * `npm start`
1. Open the application in the supported browsers (chrome/FF/Edge):
      * `http://localhost:3000`
