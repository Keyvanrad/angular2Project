# angular2project
This is my first project in angular2 to learn more about the framework and have fun with loose coupling!

1. Download the application source code
2. Install NodeJS https://nodejs.org/
3. Using the command line, goto the target folder (cd target)
4. In the commaind line run :
      npm install
      npm start
5. Open the application in the supported browsers (chrome/FF/Edge): http://localhost:3000
